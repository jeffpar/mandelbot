# Large Mandelbot (2880x1800)

This [page](https://github.com/jeffpar/mandelbot/blob/master/demos/large/INDEX.md) sets the *developer* property
to **true**, making it easier to debug the "uncompiled" version of [mandelbot.js](/src/mandelbot.js), and includes a
*Download* button.

The resolution used by this page was originally set to 2048x1536 to match the resolution of iPad "Retina Display" models,
but it was later increased to 2880x1800 to match the resolution of MacBook Pro "Retina Display" models.
