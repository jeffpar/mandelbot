MandelBot
---------

What is this project?  Like the [package.json](package.json) says:

	Generate Mandelbrot images in JavaScript using BigNumber.js
	
However, this is a work-in-progress, so you're not going to see any Mandelbrot images just yet.  I started
this project as a diversion and an excuse to learn some new things, including how to use (and possibly modify)
the [BigNumber](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js) JavaScript library.

Installation
------------

This project has already been installed at [http://mandelbot.net](http://mandelbot.net/) using
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

However, if want to install and serve your own local copy of the files, here are the steps for macOS and the
corresponding Terminal commands.

##### Step 1: Clone the project.

	git clone https://github.com/jeffpar/mandelbot.git
	cd mandelbot

##### Step 2: Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (optional if you already have Ruby).

	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	
##### Step 3: Install Ruby (optional if you already have a sufficiently current version of Ruby).

	brew install ruby

##### Step 4: Install Bundler.

	gem install bundler

##### Step 5: Install Jekyll (make sure your current directory is `mandelbot`, because this step requires the project's [Gemfile](Gemfile)). 

	bundle install

##### Step 6: Start the Jekyll server.

	bundle exec jekyll serve

##### Step 7: Fire up your web browser and visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/).

In a perfect world, the above steps would be sufficient.  Unfortunately, I ran into several problems along the way.  Those
were resolved by:

- Updating Xcode to the latest version
- Running `xcode-select --install` from a Terminal window
