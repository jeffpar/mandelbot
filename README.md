MandelBot
---------

What is this project?  For now, it's like the [package.json](package.json) says:

	Generate Mandelbrot images in JavaScript using BigNumber.js
	
This project is really just an excuse to learn some new things, including how to use the
[BigNumber](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js) JavaScript library.
